# Overview

This project was created to demonstrate how C# works and what we can achieve with basic knowledge of the language. Additional features like writing and reading files were added to add a little bit of complexity to the project.

The project is an Employee Management System where we can add employees and their data, edit information and retrieve information when anytime we need.
Classes were used to develop the program. They were used to create instances of employees, and a list of employees.
